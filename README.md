The first file in the list will be an sql file that will hold all the data.
All coding was done on Microsoft Visual 2022 C# .NET MVC.
Before running this code split files into three groups: Model, View, and Controller.  
Files with suffix .cs belong in Model folder; however, HomreController.cs is the only file in the Controller folder.  
The .cshtml files will be placed in the View folder since they will display on the web.
